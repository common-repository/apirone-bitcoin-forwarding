Key features:

* Payments forward directly into your bitcoin wallet (we do not hold your money)
* No KYC/documentation necessary
* Fixed Fee 0.0002 BTC (flat rate for any amount forever, no fee for amounts less than 100,000 Satoshi)
* White label processing (your online shop accept payments directly without redirects, iframes, payment advertisements, etc.)
* Around the world
* TOR network support
* Unlimited count of your requests (generate thousands of bitcoin addresses for thousands of your customers)


## How does it works?

1. The Buyer prepared the order and click to pay via bitcoins.
1. The Store sends bitcoin address and site callback URL to Apirone API Server. The Store receive new bitcoin address, QR code and converted the amount to BTC for payment.
1. Buyer scan QR code and pay for the order. This transaction goes to the blockchain.
* Our Server immediately got it and send a callback to supplied Store URL. Now it's first callback about the unconfirmed transaction. It's too early to pass order from Store to Buyer. We just notify that payment initiated.
* Waiting for payment confirmation on the network. Usually, it will take about ten minutes.
* Got it. After 1 confirmation our Server forward confirmed bitcoins to Store's destination address and do the second callback. Now the Buyer gets the desired order.
* Store finished order and ready for next customers.

Everyone can accept bitcoin payments!
